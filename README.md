## Open Source Intelligence Analyst

I am an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigator, trainer, and researcher with experience spanning conflict monitoring, war crimes documentation, geospatial analysis, and digital verification. My work has included building large-scale OSINT investigations for accountability, supporting legal proceedings with open-source evidence, and leading training for government, law enforcement, and international organisations. I have spoken at international conferences and workshops on the role of OSINT in human rights, security, and conflict research, and have designed academic modules and professional training programs on digital investigations. My projects have involved applying GEOINT, IMINT, and social media analysis to issues ranging from armed conflict and arms diversion to human rights abuses and disinformation, always with a focus on rigorous verification and ethical practice.
