## Open Source Intelligence Analyst

```Senior OSINT Investigator & Trainer | Conflict Monitoring, Digital Verification, and AI-Assisted Analysis```

I am an **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigator, trainer, and researcher** with experience in:
- Conflict monitoring & war crimes documentation  
- Geospatial & imagery intelligence (GEOINT/IMINT)  
- Digital verification & disinformation analysis  
- Building large-scale OSINT investigations for accountability and legal proceedings

I have delivered **training for government, law enforcement, and international organisations**, spoken at global conferences, and designed both **academic modules** and **professional programs** on digital investigations.

My projects have involved applying GEOINT, IMINT, and social media analysis to issues ranging from armed conflict and arms diversion to human rights abuses and disinformation, always with a focus on rigorous verification and ethical practice.

My current projects explore:
- **AI-assisted triaging** of messages and media  
- **Threat and violence detection** using machine learning  
- **Entity extraction & relationship mapping** for investigative workflows  
- **Human-in-the-loop verification**, ensuring automation supports â€” not replaces â€” analyst judgement

### Interests
- War crimes investigations
- Counter-Disinformation and Information Operations 
- Use of AI for *augmenting* existing capabilities and workers, **not** replacing them.

### ðŸŒ± Values
I support **eco-conscious AI**: optimising workflows to reduce compute load, and encouraging mindful use of high-resource code in digital investigations.
